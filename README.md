CloudWise web testing framework Assignment
Web Automation Framework for CloudWise Assignment

Framework Description
Framework is written in Java using BDD cucumber, and Selenium follows layered architecture for UI testing.

"src/test/resources/features" contains feature files written in Gherkin
"src/test/java/cucumber.stepDefinition" contains all the step definitions
"src/test/java/cucumber.runner" TestNG Runner
"src/test/java/lib.selenium.base" contains selenium reusable functions
"src/test/java/lib.selenium.design" contains ENUM for locators
"src/test/java/pageObjects" contains all page objects
"src/test/java/utils" contains Project

Core modules used

"Selenium-TestNG" -- Framework used to automate web
"Cucumber" -- BDD Test framework
"TestNG" -- Assertion library
"ExtentReports" -- Reporter

Requirements

Node v16.14.2(any latest version)
brew (for mac)
Chrome browser Installed
Java 8 or above(to generate report automatically)
setup

Install latest node (16.14 or above)
clone the repository
navigate to the root directory of this repository using any terminal
run following commands
    - npm install
    - brew install allure (for mac)
Test Execution - Running Via Command Line

Open terminal
Goto Project directory
to execute all test cases :
	- npm run test:all
to do a sanity test(provide the tag @sanity as argument) :
	- npm run test @sanity
to run tests on basis of tags :
	- npm run test @<tagname>
to run tests on headless mode :
Linux/Mac:
	 - npm run test:headlessmode @<tagname>
Windows:
     - npm run test:headlessmode:windows @<tagname>
to run tests on debug mode :
Linux/Mac:
	 - npm run test:debugmode @<tagname>
Windows:
     - npm run test:debugmode:windows @<tagname>
Test Report:
This framework uses allure reporter and winston logger so after execution below directories will be generated at root level:

"allure-report" contains files related to report

"allure-results" contains json and xml files related to allure reporter.

"logs" contains winston log file for execution logs

to view the report :
	- allure serve 
or

	- allure open allure-report 
The above command will open the allure html report on a browser which will provide the insights and screenshots about the test execution. For all other cucumber configuration check wdio.conf.ts

Logs:
Winston execution logs can be found on /logs folder with time stamped.

CI/CD
This framework is currently integarted with Circle CI CI/CD pipeline to run testcase click on the above Pass badge from CircleCI to view the build & execution summary or click on the below link.

Framework Important Components:
WDIO:
WebdriverIO allows you to automate any application written with modern web frameworks such as React, Angular, Polymeror Vue.js as well as native mobile applications for Android and iOS.

Reference: https://webdriver.io/

Allure reporter:
Allure Framework is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful information from everyday execution of tests.

Reference: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/

Winston logger:
winston is designed to be a simple and universal logging library with support for multiple transports. A transport is essentially a storage device for your logs. Each winston logger can have multiple transports (see: Transports) configured at different levels (see: Logging levels). For example, one may want error logs to be stored in persistent remote location (like a database), but all logs output to the console or a local file.

Chai:
Chai is an assertion library, similar to Node's built-in assert. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code

Reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston

Cucumber:
Cucumber can be used to implement automated tests based on scenarios described in your Gherkin feature files.

Reference https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/

CircleCI:
CI/CD platform delivers speed and reliability â€”in the cloud or on your private infrastructure.
